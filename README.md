# PROJECT: Capstone, Stage 1 - Design
With the Capstone project, you’ll gain the experience you need to own the full development cycle of an app. In Stage 1, you’ll communicate your own app idea formally, using an app description, UI flow mocks, and a list of required tasks to build the app. In this stage, you will hone the real-world planning skills that Android developers are expected to demonstrate on the job.

# PROJECT: Capstone, Stage 2 - Build
In this project, you’ll demonstrate the skills you've learned during your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to Google Play for distribution.
